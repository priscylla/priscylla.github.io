### üéì Teaching Philosophy

My teaching is guided by the principles of **Paulo Freire**, emphasizing dialogue, critical thinking, and student empowerment. I aim to create inclusive and interactive learning environments where students feel safe to explore, question, and grow.

I have been teaching core **computer science concepts** to diverse groups of students, ranging from **high school learners** to **undergraduate university students**. My teaching experience spans different educational levels and learning needs, allowing me to adapt methodologies to foster engagement, curiosity, and critical thinking across contexts.
