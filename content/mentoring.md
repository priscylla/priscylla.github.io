Over the past years, I have mentored more than **40 students** from high school and undergraduate programs in **research**, **social impact**, and **software development** projects.

---

#### 🎓 Undergraduate Mentoring

I've supervised students in scientific initiation, software development, and human-centered AI projects, particularly related to **Explainable AI**, **educational technologies**, and **interactive systems**.

- **Gamified Intelligent Tutoring Systems**  
  _4 students_  
  Research and development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems for programming education and data visualization.
  **Outputs**: 2 papers published at a National workshop.

#### 🏫 High School Mentoring

I mentored high school students enrolled in technical and outreach programs at federal technical high schools in Brazil, helping them explore computing beyond the classroom.

##### Research Projects

- **Programming Learning Analytics**  
  _6 students (2015–2018) – IFAL & IFSE_
  Supervised a multi-year scientific initiation project focused on analyzing how high school students learn programming in technical education settings. The research explored: Peer assessment strategies to support feedback and collaboration, Visualization of student performance and learning progress, and Identification and classification of common errors in programming exercises.
  **Outputs**: 2 papers published and presented at a regional and a national conference; prototype dashboards to support programming instruction; early exploration of learning analytics in Brazilian secondary education.

##### Social Impact Projects

- **Teaching Programming & Digital Inclusion** (2017–2018)  
  _10 students involved_   
  Mentored students in projects focused on expanding access to computing education in underserved communities. Activities included teaching basic computer use, logic, and programming to the public through initiatives.
  **Output**: Community workshops; student-led instructional materials.

- **Robotics and Educational Outreach** (2017–2018)  
  _4 students involved_   
  Led the **Robotech** group in designing and implementing robotics outreach programs for local schools. The students built robots and created engaging learning materials to introduce K–12 students to STEM.
  **Output**: Educational robotics demos; participation in local exhibitions.

- **Innovation, IoT & Smart Solutions**
  _5 students (2021)_
  Supervised interdisciplinary teams during the **Bootcamp: Ideias Inovadoras para Jovens Talentos**, where students designed IoT-based prototypes and AI solutions addressing social and environmental problems.

- **Technical Support and Systems Administration**
  _6 students (2017–2019)_
  Supported students working as teaching assistants in operating systems courses, helping peers with practical labs, maintenance, and software installation.
  **Outputs**: Peer mentoring; support documentation; improved lab operations.

- **Game & Software Design for Learning**
  _3 students (2017)_
  Guided students in the **Mestre Code** initiative, where they developed games and interactive experiences to teach programming concepts through playful methods.
  **Outputs**: Teaching assets.

##### Software Development Projects

I supervised two collaborative software development projects where high school students designed and implemented mobile applications that address real-world challenges in practical and educational contexts. Both projects resulted in official software registrations with the Brazilian patent office (INPI).

- **MyMoto** (2019)  
  A mobile app to help motorcycle owners manage maintenance records, service reminders, and repair histories.  
  _3 students involved_  
  **Output**: 🏅 Registered Software – *MyMoto*. INPI Registration No. **BR512021000801-4**, filed on **Sept 10, 2020**

- **E-nology** (2022)  
  An educational mobile app to support English teachers in computing courses by aligning vocabulary instruction with curriculum needs.  
  _2 students involved_  
  **Output**: 🏅 Registered Software – *E-nology*. INPI Registration No. **BR5120220005151-8**, filed on **March 10, 2022**
